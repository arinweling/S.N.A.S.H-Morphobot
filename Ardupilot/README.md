# <a name="_orms98skvu0"></a>Ardupilot Firmware:
##
It is a versatile and feature-rich firmware that supports various types of aircraft. Firmware for Speedybee F4 V3/V4 can be found in the Ardupilot firmware repository. 



Given the dual nature of a Morphobot (both ground and aerial operations), **Ardupilot** is likely the best choice. It supports VTOL (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) operations and can handle both ground and aerial modes effectively. This makes it ideal for a Morphobot that needs to switch between driving and flying. 

The entire Ardupilot documentation is available on: <https://ardupilots.org/copter/docs/common-speedybeef4-v3.html>

Codes are available in the Developers' community for Ardupilot Firmware. We have used that as the base model and added/ modified the codes for our usage. 

The Arducopter documentation information is available at:

<https://ardupilot.org/copter/>

<https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/learning-the-ardupilot-codebase.html> 

These websites give all information about the codes available. 

We were majorly concerned with the Copter model with additions of Drive Mode and Morphing Mode.

# <a name="_dg07wowim0e1"></a><a name="_1ce6dr2w5jn9"></a>**Loading ArduPilot onto the board[¶](https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-speedybeef4-v3.html#loading-ardupilot-onto-the-board)**
Initial firmware load can be done with DFU by plugging in USB with the bootloader button pressed. Then you should load the “with\_bl.hex” firmware, using your favourite DFU loading tool.

Once the initial firmware is loaded you can update the firmware using any ArduPilot ground station software. Updates should be done with the xxxxxxxxxx.apj firmware files.


## <a name="_xxbwp0j6x15k"></a>Compiling Ardupilot Firmware Code:
In Linux:

Open terminal in the folder containing the Ardupilot Firmware Code and Run the following commands:

- ./waf configure –-board speedybeef4v4
- ./waf copter –-board speedybeef4v4

Any syntax or firmware errors will be highlighted in one of these. If both commands are executed correctly, the code is ready to be uploaded onto SpeedyBee.


## <a name="_mmhd7fbxmgb3"></a>Uploading Ardupilot Firmware Code to SpeedyBee:
1) On Linux using Terminal: Connect the SpeedyBee to the PC via USB and run the following command:
- ./waf copter –upload
1) On Windows: In the Ardupilot Firmware Folder, go to Build → SpeedyBeeF4V4 → Bin. Find the arducopter\_with\_bl.hex file and send it to Windows. Upload this file onto SpeedBeeF4V4 using STM32Programmer.

# <a name="_jubw8syyyfq7"></a>After flashing the code:
Once the code is flashed, the bot is ready to be operated. You can run various sets of checks/ exercises to ensure correctness of your code. This can be done using the Mission Planner software.

More information on Mission Planner can be found at: <https://ardupilot.org/planner/>

We used Mission Planner for Accelerometer Calibration, Motor Testing, Radio Control Settings and Calibration ,etc.


# <a name="_tasxwk6amcuk"></a>Important Cares and Caveats:
## <a name="_nqqtgtdk2uep"></a>Arming:
Ensure that the bot arms correctly on switching to any of the drone modes. If that is not the case, it is a good practice to check the connections and battery. You can connect to Mission Planner and check if there is Pre Arm failure. There will be a set of errors visible (gyros not calibrated, RC absent, Battery Voltage Low, etc.). You can then troubleshoot the problems.

More information can be obtained at: <https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/arming_the_motors.html>


## <a name="_kj67tnu702jq"></a>Motor Configuration and Testing:
Motors and Propellers must be connected in proper order and direction for the drone mode. We used the Quad Frame Class and Hexa Frame Type for our bot. More information is available at: <https://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/connect-escs-and-motors.html/>

In the full parameter list of the Config tab of Mission Planner, you can see all the frame types and the corresponding toke number. This token number will be written in the config.h file before building the firmware code. Then look at the servo 1 to 4 parameters. You need to assign each of them to the motors M1 to M4 (values 34 to 37). This can be done iteratively based on the diagram of the chosen frame from the above website and by testing the Motors. This can be done in the Setup tab in the Test Motors option. Testing motors iteratively and varying the assigned tokens you can assign the correct number to the motor and the direction (CW / CCW). These values must also be written in the config.h file.

ArduPilot is the most advanced, full-featured, and reliable open source autopilot software available.
It has been under development since 2010 by a diverse team of professional engineers, computer scientists, and community contributors.
Our autopilot software is capable of controlling almost any vehicle system imaginable, from conventional airplanes, quad planes, multi-rotors, and helicopters to rovers, boats, balance bots, and even submarines.
It is continually being expanded to provide support for new emerging vehicle types.
